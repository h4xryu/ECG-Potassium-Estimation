# ECG-Potassium-Estimation

## Project Description

**ECG-Potassium-Estimation** is a deep learning project designed to process ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals for predicting potassium (K⁺) concentrations. The project employs complex neural network architectures built using **PyTorch** to solve classification and regression problems based on ECG data. This project is currently **under development**.

## Installation and Execution

### 1. Set Up the Environment

Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install torch dask networkx numpy
```

### 2. Execute the Program

#### Test Run

```bash
python run.py
```

This will initialize the model and display example output to verify the implementation.

## Key Files and Functionality

### 1. `models/ECG_12Net.py`

#### Features
- Implements modular neural network blocks such as `DenseBlock`, `TransitionLayer`, and `PoolingBlock`.
- Defines core models, including `ECG12Net` and `EMPNet`, to handle ECG signal processing and K⁺ concentration prediction.
- Provides data preprocessing utilities like `encode_k_class` and `encode_k_concentration`.

#### Model Overview
- **ECG12Net**: Processes 12-lead ECG data in parallel, combining individual lead information into a unified representation.
- **EMPNet**: Processes additional input features for enhanced predictions.

### 2. `train.py`

#### Features
- **`train_model`**: Handles the training loop, saving the best model based on validation loss.
- **`create_dataloaders`**: Prepares data loaders using a `WeightedRandomSampler` to address class imbalance.

---

### 3. `run.py`

#### Features
- Initializes the model and generates sample data.
- Displays initial predictions for validation.

## Current Status and Future Work

### Incomplete Features
- Dataset loading and processing (e.g., `ECGDataset` class is missing).
- Integration of real-world datasets and validation metrics.
- Optimization for better model performance.

### Next Steps
- Complete the `train.py` pipeline by integrating training and validation.
- Add data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluations.
